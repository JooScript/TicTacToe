# Tic-Tac-Toe Game (C# WinForms)

## ðŸŽ¯ Overview
This is a simple **Tic-Tac-Toe** game developed using **C# WinForms**, adhering to the **Separation of Concerns (SoC)** principle for enhanced modularity and maintainability.

## ðŸ”‘ Key Features
âœ” **Responsive UI** â€“ Interactive and user-friendly interface for smooth gameplay.  
âœ” **Game Logic** â€“ Implements turn-based play, win/draw detection, and automatic game reset.  
âœ” **Event-Driven Programming** â€“ Enhances user interactions with button-click event handlers.  
âœ” **Separation of Concerns** â€“ Decouples UI, game logic, and event handling for better maintainability.

## ðŸ›  Tech Stack
- **C# WinForms** â€“ For building the graphical user interface.
- **Event-Driven Programming** â€“ Manages user interactions dynamically.
